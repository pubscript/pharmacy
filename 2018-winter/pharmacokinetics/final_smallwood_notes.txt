3 point evaluation
k_e gives you two points on the same line
volume of distribution: use the trough peak given
choose the right vancomycin table to choose the dose from
extended dose aminoglycoside 7mg/kg gentamicin tobramicin or 15 mg/kg amikacin <- weight based dosing

random level 6-14 hrs out is hwo we determine safety. triangle determines how often to get the dose. number of hours out to the dose

amikacin: twice the dose, so divide the level by 2 before applying it to the triangels or the Hartford nomogram

valproic acid & majority of antiepiletpics: highly protein-bound

digoxin: very old drug; long half life = 36hr
