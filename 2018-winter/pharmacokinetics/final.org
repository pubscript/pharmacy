3. since the nomogram is based on 7 mg/kg (gentamicin and tobramycin), if a different dosing strategy X mg/kg is being used, multiply your result by 7/X; e.g., for 15 mg/kg (amikacin), multiply your result by 7/15 ≈ 1/2

** [#B] dialysis :l:
*** hemodialysis
- 3x/week
- perfuses blood across a semi-permeable membrane to remove solutes, water, and waste
- an anastamosis between an artery and a vein is created in advance to access the blood to be filtered
- hemodialysis is the standard and well-known method of dialysis
*** hemofiltration
- blood is filtered at a much slower rate
- hydrostatic pressure moves fluids and solutes across the membrane (by “convection”)
*** high flux hemodialysis
- can remove larger molecules that are not efficiently removed by hemodialysis
- larger pores than standard hemodialysis
*** continuous rental replacement
- ~1 L/hr, continuously
- often used in hemodynamically unstable patients---e.g., acute renal failure, fluid overload---because it’s more hemodynamically forgiving and less likely to cause hypotension
*** peritoneal dialysis
- uses patient’s own peritoneal cavity as a reservoir and the patient’s own peritoneal membrane as a filter; filtrate is eventually drained from the peritoneal cavity
- can be completed once a day (manual) or on a continuous cycler machine while the patient is sleep
** chronic
*** [#B] definition
- Progressive loss of kidney function over months to years
- Normal renal parenchyma is replaced by interstitial fibrosis
- results in loss of kidney function

* dialysis :l:
** Hemodialysis
Hemodialysis uses a machine that perfuses blood across a semi-permeable membrane to remove water, solutes and wastes /by diffusion/
** Hemofiltration
blood is moved across a semipermeable membrane and hydrostatic pressure is applied to force fluid and solutes across the membrane /by convection rather than diffusion/ /without use of any dialysate fluid/
** High flux hemodialysis
- uses a dialysis membrane that has larger pores than standard hemodialysis
- High flux hemodialysis removes smaller molecules more efficiently and can remove larger molecules that are not removed with standard hemodialysis
** Continuous Renal Replacement (CRRT)
ultrafiltration process with a large pore membrane Filters both water and solutes (including drugs)
** Peritoneal dialysis
Peritoneal dialysis is a method of dialyzing a patient using his/her own peritoneal cavity as a reservoir and the peritoneal membrane as a filter
