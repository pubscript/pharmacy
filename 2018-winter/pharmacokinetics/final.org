* dialysis :l:
** Hemodialysis
Hemodialysis uses a machine that perfuses blood across a semi-permeable membrane to remove water, solutes and wastes /by diffusion/
** Hemofiltration
blood is moved across a semipermeable membrane and hydrostatic pressure is applied to force fluid and solutes across the membrane /by convection rather than diffusion/ /without use of any dialysate fluid/
** High flux hemodialysis
- uses a dialysis membrane that has larger pores than standard hemodialysis
- High flux hemodialysis removes smaller molecules more efficiently and can remove larger molecules that are not removed with standard hemodialysis
** Continuous Renal Replacement (CRRT)
ultrafiltration process with a large pore membrane Filters both water and solutes (including drugs)
** Peritoneal dialysis
Peritoneal dialysis is a method of dialyzing a patient using his/her own peritoneal cavity as a reservoir and the peritoneal membrane as a filter
* lithium
** adverse drug reactions
- Hypothyroidism with or without goiter formation
- Electrocardiographic abnormalities
