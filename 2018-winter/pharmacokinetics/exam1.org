* # of half lives to steady state
5
* factors affecting clearance
- cardiac output
- renal function
* pharmacokinetic models
** compartments
*** central compartment
**** properties
- instantaneous drug distribution
- highly perfused
**** examples
- system circulation
- heart
- liver
- kidney
*** peripheral or tissue compartment
**** properties
- slow drug distribution
- less perfused
**** examples
other tissues or organs
*** deep tissue compartmnet
**** properties
- slower drug distribtuion
- poorly perfused
**** examples
- adipose tissue
- bone
* intravenous infusion
** continuous IV infusion
*** steady state
infusion rate = elimination rate
or
rate of drug input = rate of drug output
