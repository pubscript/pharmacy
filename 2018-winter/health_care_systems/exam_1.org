*** Locus of Control
Attainment of a particular outcome is either within one’s control or outside of it.
*** Health Belief Model
Likelihood that one will take action or change behavior.
*** Social Cognitive Theory
- outcome expectation—belief that a behavior will have some outcome
- efficacy expectation—belief that one will be able to change
  - Performance accomplishments
  - Vicarious experience
  - Verbal persuasion
  - Physiological state
*** Theories of Reasoned Action and Planned Behavior

** Healthy People 2020
- Provides comprehensive framework for health promotion and disease prevention
- Tracking of data-driven outcomes to monitor progress 
- Engages a multi-disciplinary network of stakeholders
- Guides national research on public health
- Establishes accountability – must demonstrate support  of Health People objectives for grants
* economics
** demand
amounts of a commodity that consumers are /willing and able/ to purchase at a set of possible prices over a specified period of time
*** factors that change demand
- prices of related goods
  - substitutes
  - complements
- income of consumer
- number of other consumers in the market
- attitudes, tastes, and preferences of the consumer
- consumer expectations of future prices or future income
*** elasticity (2 questions)
the responsiveness of consumer demands to a change in price
**** types :l:
***** elastic demand
increase in price ⇒ decrease in revenue
***** inelastic demand
increase in price ⇒ revenue still increases
***** unitary demand
- price changes ⇒ revenue doesn’t change
- doesn’t happen in the real world
**** healthcare costs that a patient must pay out of pocket—elastic or inelastic?
elastic; the patient often foregoes treatment
*** perfectly competitive market
**** characteristics 
- many buyers and sellers
- freedom of entry and exit
- standardized products
- free information
- no collusion
**** healthcare
healthcare is not a perfectly competitive market:
- consolidation among sellers and buyers; maldistribution of supply
- high barriers to entry for suppliers (e.g., healthcare providers, manufacturers)
- care is individualized, inconsistent, and difficult to measure; so the “product” is not standardized
*** improving healthcare
- healthcare as a public utility
- improve costs and quality
  - pay for performance
  - tiered cost sharing
- create incentives
** pharmacoeconomics
*** goal
outcomes outweigh costs
*** cost
**** economic cost
the consumption of a resource that could otherwise be used for another purpose
**** opportunity cost
value of the benefits foregone because the resource is not available for its best alternative
**** direct medical costs
e.g., physician fees, X-ray costs, prescription costs
**** direct non-medical costs
e.g., transportation to healthcare providers, specific diet
**** indirect costs
- loss in productivity due to morbidity and mortality due to disease
- hard to measure
**** intangible costs
- “emotional stress, fear, anxiety, psychological effects”
- hardest to measure
*** outcome
**** types
***** structure outcomes
***** process outcomes
e.g., accuracy of directions on prescription label
***** clinical outcomes
- safety and efficacy
- uses intermediate measures as proxy indicators of outcomes; e.g., INR is the outcome for warfarin instead of strokes because strokes are unpredictable
***** economic outcomes
healthcare expenditures
*** ECHO
“Economic Clincial Humanistic Outcomes” model
*** pharmacoeconomic evaluations
