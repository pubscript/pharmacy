** Sedatives-Hypnotics and Antiseizure Drugs
*** For Antiseizure drugs
**** TODO Features of ideal structural features and class of various antiseizure drugs.
**** TODO [#A] I want you to remember the structure of basic class, hydantoins, barbiturates, succinimides, oxazolidinediones, dibenzazepines, benzodiazepines, sulfonamides.
**** TODO MOA of barbituates
**** TODO Difference between sulfamate and sulfonamide group and how they can interact with Carbonic anhydrase.
**** TODO Solubility and structure of sodium salt of phenytoin vs phenytoin (see active learning), and how it should be infused
**** TODO Advantage of fosphenytoin over phenytoin and its pharmacological significance and relevance. 
water solubility
**** TODO Advantage of oxycarbamazepine over carbamazepine.
oxycarbamazepine cannot be metabolized easily. oxycarbamazeine has less autoinduction.
**** TODO Least sedating effect of carbamazepine over others old class of anti seizure agents.
**** TODO Agents which are structurally related to GABA and their mechanism of action.
*** Sedatives and Hypnotics:
**** TODO MOA, drug activity, bioavailability, hydrophilicity, lipophilicity, potency, duration of action, onset of action, acidity, basicity, etc, of the all sedatives and hypnotics 
**** TODO Identify the physicochemical properties of these drugs (acidic or basic nature, lipophilicity, hydrophilicity)
**** TODO Significance, advantages and disadvantages of Melatonin as a hormone and as drug
**** TODO Use of Melatonin analog as a drug and its MOA
