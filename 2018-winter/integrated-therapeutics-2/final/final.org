* sleep disorders
** definition
changes in the normal sleep cycle that can negatively affect your health
*** primary
not attributable to any other condition
*** secondary
attributable to an identifiable cause---e.g., medication or disease state
*** dyssomia
Dyssomnias are a broad classification of sleeping disorders involving difficulty getting to sleep, remaining asleep, or of excessive sleepiness.
*** parasomnia
Parasomnias are a category of sleep disorders that involve abnormal movements, behaviors, emotions, perceptions, and dreams that occur while falling asleep, sleeping, between sleep stages, or during arousal from sleep. Most parasomnias are dissociated sleep states which are partial arousals during the transitions between wakefulness and NREM sleep, or wakefulness and REM sleep.

**** cataplexy
- abrupt loss of muscle tone
- narcolepsy + cataplexy is the most common
- Cataplexy is a sudden and transient episode of muscle weakness accompanied by full conscious awareness, typically triggered by emotions such as laughing, crying, or terror.[1] Cataplexy affects approximately 70% of people who have narcolepsy,[2] and is caused by an autoimmune destruction of neurons that produce the neuropeptide hypocretin (also called orexin), which regulates arousal and wakefulness. Cataplexy without narcolepsy is rare and the cause is unknown.
