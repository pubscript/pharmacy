* Parkinson’s disease
** symptoms
*** classical clinical features
- tremor-resting
- rigidity
- akinesia/bradykinesia
- posture and gait
** causes
*** genetics
- parkin
- α-synuclein
*** environment :l:
**** oxidative stress
- dopamine neurons are acutely sensitive to oxidative damage
- In Parkinson’s disease, iron content is increased in the substantia nigra, which promotes ROS formation from H2O2 in the oxidation (via MAO) of dopamine. The Fe pathway is in opposition to the reductive pathway via glutathione/glutathione peroxidase.
**** neuroleptic-induced Parkinsonism
- phenothiazines
- bytrophenones
- resperine
** drug classes :l:
*** dopaminergic agents :l:
**** L-DOPA
***** efficacy
- most effective drug for Parkinsonian symptoms
- Virtually all patients with confirmed PD experience clinically significant benefit.
*** dopamine agonists
**** drug classes
***** ergot derivatives :l:
****** bromocriptine
******* brand
Parlodel
******* indications
- Parkinsonism
- neuroleptic malignant syndrome
- diabetes
******* adverse drug reactions
Erythromelalgia and Raynaud’s phenomena
****** cabergoline
****** pergolide
******* brand
Permax
***** non-ergot derivatives :l:
****** pramipexole
******* brand
Requip
****** ropinirole
******* brand
Mirapex
****** rotigotine
******* brand
Neupro
**** adverse drug reactions
- not as effective as L-DOPA
- Erythromelalgia and Raynaud’s phenomena
*** DA metabolism inhibitors :l:
**** decarboxylase inhibitors :l:
***** Carbidopa
**** MAO-B inhibitors :l:
***** Selegiline
****** mechanism of action
- irreversible MAO-B inhibitor
- dose-dependent selectivity
****** therapeutics
adjunctive therapy with L-DOPA
****** brand :l:
******* Eldepryl
metabolized by CYP enzymes to (meth)amphetamine
******* Zelapar
ODT
- bypasses first-pass metabolism
- doesn’t metabolize to amphetamine or methamphetamine metabolites
- fewer side effects
****** Rasagiline
******* brand
Azilect
******* mechanism of action
selective irreversible MAO-B inhibitor; can be used as monotherapy
******* benefits
- Decreases “off” time for patients on stable doses of carbidopa/levodopa
- No amphetamine like metabolites, so improved tolerability
****** Salfinamide
******* brand
Xadago
******* contraindications
severe hepatic impairment
**** COMT inhibitors :l:
***** Entacapone
****** brand
Comtan
***** Tolcapone
****** brand
Tasmar
*** antimuscarinic agents :l:
**** benztropine
***** brand
Cogentin
**** trihexyphenidyl
***** brand
Artane
*** amantadine
* Alzheimer’s
** cholinesterase inhibitors
*** drugs :l:
**** donepezil
***** mechanism of action
non-competitive inhibitor of AChE
***** brand
Aricept
**** rivastigmine
***** brand
Exelon
***** mechanism of action
non-competitive (pseudo-irreversible) inhibitor of AChE
**** galantamine
***** brand
Razadyne
***** mechanism of action
Competitive, reversible centrally-acting cholinesterase inhibitor AND nAChR agonist
**** tacrine
** memantine
*** mechanism of action
Memantine binds to the magnesium biding site, and functions as an effective receptor blocker under conditions of excessive stimulation
*** therapeutics
- moderate-to-severe dementia/Alzheimer’s
- in combination with donepezil or monotherapy
