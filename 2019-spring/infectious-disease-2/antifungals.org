* drug classes
** polyene macrolides
*** nystatin
**** chemistry
polyene macrolide
**** mechanism of action
*** amphotericin B
**** brands
- Fungizone
- Abelcet
- AmBsome
**** mechanism of action
- directly binds to ergosterol to cause osmotic shock
- oxidatively damages fungus; reactive oxygen species
** ergosterol synthesis inhibitors (azoles)
*** imidiazoles
**** mechanism of action
inhibits fungal cytochrome P450 3A dependent enzyme 14-α-demethylase---which synthesizes ergosterol from lanosterol in the fungal cell membrane, thereby destabilizing the membrane
**** drugs :l:
***** Ketoconazole
****** brand
Nizoral
****** adverse drug reactions
- inhibits human P450 enzymes
- altered steroidogenesis
  - Menstrual irregularities
  - Loss of libido
  - Impotence
  - Gynecomastia in males
***** Miconazole
****** brand
Monistat
***** Clotrimazole
****** brand
Lotrimin
*** triazoles :l:
**** Fluconazole
***** brand
Diflucan
**** Itraconazole
***** brand
Sporanox
**** Voriconazole
***** brand
Vfend
**** Posaconazole
***** brand
Noxafil
** cell wall inhibitors
*** echinocandins
**** mechanism of action
non-competitively inhibits β-(1,3) glucan synthase---which synthesizes β-(1,3) glucan, a major component of the fungal cell wall
**** drugs :l:
***** Caspofungin
****** brand
Cancidas
***** Anidulafungin
****** brand
Eraxis
***** Micafungin
****** brand
Mycamine
**** [#B] adverse drug reactions
flushing; release of histamine
** nucleic acid synthesis inhibitors
*** drugs :l:
**** flucytosine
***** brand
Ancobon
*** mechanism of action
- competes with uracil and thymidine in synthesis of RNA and DNA, respectively
  - deaminates to 5-fluorouracil via cytosine deaminases
  - as a pyrimidine analogue, it competes with uracil in the synthesis of RNA
  - competes with thymidine during the synthesis of DNA
- highly selective for fungus; humans cannot deaminate 5-fluorocytosine
*** adverse drug reactions
affects metabolism---fluorouracil is antineoplastic and toxic to intestinal flora
** mitosis inhibitors
*** mechanism of action
- targets microtubules
- disrupts mitotic spindle to inhibit mitosis
*** drugs :l:
**** griseofulvin
** allylamines
*** drugs :l:
**** terbinafine
*** mechanism of action
inhibits squalene oxidase---ergosterol’s synthesis pathway
* antifungal targets :l:
** protein synthesis
*** drugs
- sordarins
- azasordarins
** cell wall synthesis
*** glycan synthesis
- echinocandins
*** chitin synthesis
- nikkomycin
** nucleic acid synthesis
*** drugs
- flucytosine
** cell membrane synthesis
*** drugs
- azoles
- allylamines
** mitosis and microtubules
*** drugs
griseofulvin
** membrane integrity
*** drugs
- polyenes
* fungal resistance
1. Enzyme targeted by antifungal is overproduced
2. Antifungal is pumped out by an efflux pump
3. Target of antifungal is altered so that the antifungal no longer binds
4. Antifungal entry into the fungus is prevented
5. Fungus uses an alternate (“bypass”) pathway not inhibited by the antifungal
6. Fungal enzymes that activate antifungals are inhibited
7. Fungus secretes an enzyme which degrades antifungal
