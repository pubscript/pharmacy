***** TODO [#A] structure
***** [#A] metabolism
- flucytosine → 5-fluorouracil → 5-FdUMP
- flucytosine is a prodrug
***** [#A] active metabolite
5-FdUMP
***** [#A] mechanism of action
- competes with uracil and thymidine in synthesis of RNA and DNA, respectively
  - deaminates to 5-fluorouracil via cytosine deaminases
  - as a pyrimidine analogue, it competes with uracil in the synthesis of RNA
  - competes with thymidine during the synthesis of DNA
- highly selective for fungus; humans cannot deaminate 5-fluorocytosine
***** TODO [#A] adverse drug reactions
affects metabolism---fluorouracil is antineoplastic and toxic to intestinal flora
** mitosis inhibitors
*** mechanism of action
- targets microtubules
- disrupts mitotic spindle to inhibit mitosis
*** drugs :l:
**** griseofulvin
***** [#A] mechanism of action
- binds to fungal RNA
- inhibits cell wall biosynthesis
***** structure activity relationship
- -OCH3 methoxy group on the cyclohexene confers lipophillicity to penetrate into fungal cells
- larger substituents would dininish fungal cell penetration
** allylamines
*** drugs :l:
**** terbinafine
*** mechanism of action

* [#A] fungal resistance
1. Enzyme targeted by antifungal is overproduced
2. Antifungal is pumped out by an efflux pump
3. Target of antifungal is altered so that the antifungal no longer binds
4. Antifungal entry into the fungus is prevented
5. Fungus uses an alternate (“bypass”) pathway not inhibited by the antifungal
6. Fungal enzymes that activate antifungals are inhibited
7. Fungus secretes an enzyme which degrades antifungal
