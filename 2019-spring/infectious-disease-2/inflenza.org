* questions
** Which of the following patients have an increased risk of getting influenza but not having symptoms?
young person
* incubation period
[-1, 5] days
* signs and symptoms
- fever
- exhaustion
- fatigue
- headache
- aches and pain
- cough
* antigenic shift vs. antigenic drift
** antigenic drift
- small changes in the influenza viruses via point mutation in the surface antigen
- reason for changing the influenza vaccine annually
** antigenic drift
influenza virus acquires new hemagglutinin or neuramidinase via genetic reassortment
* complications
** conditions
- pneumonia, primary influenza or secondary bacterial
- exacerbations of underlying diseases
  - CHF
  - COPD
  - asthma
** high risk populations
- children <5; esp. <2 or receiving aspirin
- adults ≥65; nursing home residents
- pregnant women
- immunosuppression
- chronic diseases
- Amerindians
* [#A] contraindications
- HIV; low CD4 count
- pregnant women
* drug classes :l:
** M2 inhibitors---amantadines
- amantadine
- rimantadine
*** indication
influenza A only
*** mechanism of resistance
mutation or absence of M2 receptor
** neuraminidase inhibitors
- Zanamivir
- Oseltamivir
- Peramivir
*** mechanism of resistance
mutation in neuraminidase
** cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitors
Baloxavir Marboxil
*** mechanism of resistance
variants of polymerase
** nucleoside inhibitors
Ribavarin
*** mechanism of resistance
mutation of the RNA polymerase
* [#A] target → drugs
** uncoating
- Amantadine (Symmetrel, Mantadix, Amantan)
- Rimantadine
** viral release
- Zanamivir (Relenza)
