* pathophysiology
** organ systems affected
- respiratory
- digestive
- reproductive
** [#A] common mutations
mutations in the CFTR protein (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator)
1. ΔF508 (most common)
2. G551D
** mechanisms
- low lung volume
  1. ↑ absorption of Na, Cl, and fluid
  2. dehydrated airways
  3. defective mucociliary transport
- high salt theory
** signs and symptoms
*** [#A] classic
- Bacterial infections are late in onset
- Chronic sinusitis
- Hepatobiliary disease
- Adequate pancreatic function
- Meconium ileum at birth
- Obstructive azospermia
- Sweat chloride level > 90
*** [#A] non-classic
- a typically later onset of and less severe pulmonary infections
- a sweat chloride level <90
- less likely to have...
  - hepatobiliary disease
  - pancreatic insufficiency
  - meconium ileus at birth
** risk factors for bone disease
- malabsorption of vitamin D
- glucocorticoid therapy
- chronic infections
* diagnosis
** immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT)
chemical produced by the pancreas
** quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis sweat test (QPIT)
1. stimulate sweat secretion
2. measure sweat content
   - normal: ≤39
   - intermediate: 40-59
   - abnormal: ≥60
